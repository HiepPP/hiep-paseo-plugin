# TASK-004 Outcome

## Outcome

Status: BLOCKED

Changed:
- Implemented scoped trackpad listener and touch horizontal intent with momentum protection and cleanup.

Contract:
- The approved implementation is a standalone plugin page. Paseo source and native sidebar project rows remain unchanged.
- Existing projects, workspace IDs, paths, and agents are preserved.

Verified:
- Direction, threshold, diagonal intent, boundaries, and momentum unit tests pass. Desktop automation scroll/drag did not trigger navigation; physical device behavior remains unverified.
- Plugin commands: `npm run format`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` pass; six focused tests pass.
- `paseo plugin ls workspace-spaces --json` reports running. Plugin logs show ready without load errors.

Limitations:
- Physical trackpad/touch, compact mobile layout, and simultaneous multi-client saves were not exercised.
- Save conflict behavior relies on the host revision-checked settings API; no live conflict was injected.

Handoff:
- Spaces 1, 2, and 3 are available as initial user tabs. All projects are back in Space 1.
- The original workspace view was restored. No temporary server, credential, or test project was created.
- BLOCKED: Verify a physical horizontal swipe on the installed page before declaring gesture acceptance complete.

## Desktop sidebar update

- User approved private DOM injection after reviewing the generated concept.
- The installed plugin adds bottom tabs and Space destinations to existing project menus.
- Live check: moved wp-test to Space 2; only its project and existing session remained visible.
- Live check: disable restored all 15 project groups and removed controls and menu additions.
- Live check: enable preserved membership; moved wp-test back to Space 1 and restored selection.
- Eleven tests pass, including DOM filtering, wheel handling, rerenders, errors, and cleanup.
- Typecheck and lint pass. Physical trackpad input remains unverified; TASK-004 stays BLOCKED for acceptance.
- Existing Paseo source changes were preserved; no source file there was edited.
