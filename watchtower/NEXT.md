## Plan Verify

- For TASK-007–012, run the orchestrator format, typecheck, lint, and offline tests.
- Verify the installed orchestrator and live child model/effort, task outputs, timing, and cleanup.
- Report baseline comparisons separately from synthetic/offline tests. Preserve TASK-004.

- Run plugin format, typecheck, lint, and tests.
- Verify the plugin runs and the existing sidebar supports tabs, project moves, and scoped wheel events.
- Verify membership survives reload and existing coding workspaces remain intact.
- Record device/browser limitations without claiming untested behavior.

## Handoff

- TASK-013 desktop DOM adapter approved and installed. Complete live acceptance and record limitations.

- TASK-007–012 complete: Jev orchestrator installed; 24 tests and real MCP/child execution verified.
- [Live comparison](../plugins/jev-orchestrator/VERIFICATION.md): routed workflows passed but were slower on two small fixtures; no savings claim.

- Board is installed and running. Desktop light/dark, sidebar placement, and a real run transition are verified.
- Board retains 50 observed finished conversations in memory. Native mobile acceptance remains unverified.
- Spaces sidebar adapter implemented and installed. TASK-004 awaits physical swipe acceptance; other Spaces tasks are complete.
- Swipe horizontally across the native left-sidebar project list. Verify one adjacent tab per gesture.
- Fifteen tests, typecheck, lint, native project moves, filtering, and live disable/enable cleanup pass.
- Physical trackpad input remains unverified. Paseo source is unchanged. Mobile retains the standalone fallback.
