# Jev permission gate

Answers shell permission requests for Paseo agents before they reach the user.
Regex handles the certain cases; Jev classifies the rest; anything uncertain stays with the user.

Order per `agent.permission_requested` with a shell command:

1. Regex deny: `rm -rf`, `git push`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean -f`, `sudo`,
   pipe into a shell, `find -delete`, secret files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `credentials`).
2. Regex escalate: an interpreter running a script file. Its contents are invisible to the gate.
3. Regex allow: a single non-compound `ls/cat/head/tail/wc/rg/grep/find/pwd/which/stat`, a
   read-only `git` subcommand, or exactly `npm test`, `npm run typecheck|lint|check`, `npx tsc --noEmit`.
4. Jev: boolean `readOnly` plus choice `allow | deny | escalate`. Allow needs both at
   probability >= 0.9; deny needs >= 0.9; otherwise no answer and the user decides.
5. Jev timeout, API error, or invalid answer: no answer, user decides.

Non-tool requests (plan, question, mode) and tools without a shell command are ignored.

Decisions append to `$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/jev-permission-gate/decisions.jsonl` (0600) with a
command hash, decision, source, probabilities, and timing; command text is not stored. Only the
command, tool name, and workspace-relative cwd are sent to Jev through the existing
`agents.providers.vercel-gateway.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Evidence: 30 labeled shell commands scored 30/30 in
`plugins/jev-evaluator/artifacts/jev-benchmark-2026-09-22T11-51-03-364Z/report.md`, a synthetic set
with the policy stated in the state. Real workloads are not measured. Without the command list context of that benchmark, Jev rated
`npm test` allow at only 0.72 because script contents are unknown, so package scripts other than the
exact regex forms end with the user. Jev cannot see script
contents, heredocs, or the filesystem; the regex tiers stay in front of it.
